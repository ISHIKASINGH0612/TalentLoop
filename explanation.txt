WE ARE USING SHADCNUI FOR MAKING UI COMPONENTS

shadcn/ui is a modern UI component system for React that provides pre-built, accessible, and customizable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, where components are copied directly into your project instead of being installed as a dependency; this gives you full control over the code, styling, and behavior, makes customization easy, avoids dependency lock-in, and is ideal for building clean, scalable, and production-ready interfaces (especially popular with React, Vite, and Next.js projects).

SINCE OUR WEBSITE IS OF MULTIPAGE, WE WILL NEED REACT ROUTER DOM

 npm i react-router-dom
 React Router ek library hai jo React app ko multiple pages jaisa behave karwati hai
— bina page reload ke.
Matlab:
URL change hota hai (/login, /jobs, /profile)
Browser reload nahi hota
React different components dikhata hai
