WE ARE USING SHADCNUI FOR MAKING UI COMPONENTS

shadcn/ui is a modern UI component system for React that provides pre-built, accessible, and customizable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, where components are copied directly into your project instead of being installed as a dependency; this gives you full control over the code, styling, and behavior, makes customization easy, avoids dependency lock-in, and is ideal for building clean, scalable, and production-ready interfaces (especially popular with React, Vite, and Next.js projects).
